I am Haixia Han(韩海霞), a first-year Ph.D. candidate at East China Normal University, Shanghai, China. I am advised by Prof ![Yanghua Xiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=odFW4FoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at ![Knowledge Works Lab] (http://kw.fudan.edu.cn/) of Fudan University. 

During my master's studies, my research mainly focused on data mining, recommender systems and multi-armed bandit.

Currently, I have a broad interest in Natural Language Processing, with a current focus on Large Language Models and their capability boundaries. I am fascinated by the self-reflective capability of large language model and continuous learning in large language model.
