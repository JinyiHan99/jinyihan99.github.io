I am Haixia Han(韩海霞), a first-year Ph.D. candidate at East China Normal University, Shanghai, China. I am advised by Prof <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=odFW4FoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Yanghua Xiao</a> at <a href="http://kw.fudan.edu.cn/">Knowledge Works Lab</a> of Fudan University. 

During my master's studies, my research mainly focused on *Data Mining*, *Recommender Systems* and *Multi-armed Bandit*.

Currently, I have a broad interest in Natural Language Processing, with a focus on Large Language Models and their capability boundaries. I am fascinated by the self-reflective capability of large language model and continuous learning in large language model.
